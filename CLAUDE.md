# NavBharatAI — Session Constitution

This file is auto-loaded at the start of every Claude Code session in this
repo. It exists because **more than one Claude account/session works on this
project, sequentially (never at the same time)** — credits run out on one,
work continues later from another account/session. These rules exist to stop
that handoff from breaking the app or wasting work. They rarely change; the
living, constantly-updated status (current phase, exact resume point, what's
done) lives in `PROGRESS.md`, not here.

## The one absolute rule

**The app must never break — no matter how much time or credit it takes.**
Goal: make NavBharatAI the world's best AI app maker. Every rule below exists
to protect that one rule.

## The 7 safeguards (mandatory, every session)

1. **Fresh-state check before trusting any doc.** At the start of every
   session: `git fetch origin main` + `git log --oneline -10` (and check open
   PRs) BEFORE believing what `PROGRESS.md` claims is done. `PROGRESS.md` can
   go stale the moment another session pushes after it was written — this
   happened for real (PR #1 and PR #4 were redundant work built blind on a
   stale picture of `main`). Treat the actual git state as ground truth;
   treat the doc as a hint.

2. **Phase-level lock + exact resume point.** Don't start, redo, or
   "improve" a phase another session is actively working on or has already
   completed — find the exact next un-done item and continue from there, not
   from a clean slate. A lock is only released when a phase is marked
   **DONE** in `PROGRESS.md`, or by explicit admin (user) override. If it's
   unclear whether a phase is locked/owned, ask the admin rather than
   guessing or duplicating.

3. **0.01% doubt → stop and ask the admin.** If there is ANY doubt — even
   minimal — that a change risks breaking the app, conflicts with the other
   session's in-flight work, or touches architecture you're not fully sure
   about: STOP. Do not push, do not commit, do not guess. Ask the admin
   directly: state the exact risk and the options. Never silently take the
   "probably fine" path on anything with breakage risk.

4. **Commit small, commit often — never bet on a graceful save.** Don't wait
   to commit until "right before credits run out" — credit cutoffs are often
   abrupt, not graceful, and that bet loses work. Commit after every
   meaningful sub-step within a phase (not just at the end of the whole
   phase), so the maximum possible loss window is small.

5. **Mandatory verification gate before every push — never skipped.**
   `npx tsc --noEmit` (frontend) + `npx tsc -p tsconfig.server.json` (server,
   if touched) + `npx vitest run` (read the actual pass/fail line, don't
   trust a truncated `tail`) + a manual/boot smoke check for server changes.
   This gate is non-negotiable, even under time or credit pressure.

6. **Redundant-work check before starting anything new.** Before building a
   new feature or fix, grep/search the current `main` to confirm it doesn't
   already exist. This is not optional housekeeping — it is what would have
   prevented PR #1 and PR #4 from being built at all.

7. **If you find lost/uncommitted work from a previous session: audit, don't
   restart.** When resuming after an interruption (e.g. a credit cutoff that
   left work uncommitted), do NOT blindly restart the whole phase from 0.
   First audit the actual committed + verified state (`git log`, `tsc`,
   tests, manual check). Identify ONLY the genuine gap between "what's
   committed and verified" and "what PROGRESS.md claims" — redo just that
   gap. Touching/redoing already-working committed code wastes credit and
   risks reintroducing bugs into code that was already correct.

## Where things live

- **`CLAUDE.md`** (this file) — rules that rarely change. Auto-loaded.
- **`PROGRESS.md`** — living state: current phase, exact resume point, what's
  done, what's next. Changes constantly. Must be read explicitly (not
  auto-loaded) — see safeguard #1, read it but verify it against real git
  state first.
- Never push directly to `main`. Every change goes: branch → commit → push →
  PR. Even documentation-only changes follow this.
